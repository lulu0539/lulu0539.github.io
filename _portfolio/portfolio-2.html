title: "Project 2: RENTAL CLUB"
excerpt: Renting an apartment is a big problem for international students who come to study abroad for the first time. Hence, we have designed a rental club that allows international students to get information about the current rental climate in Australia in a safer, more trustworthy environment, and to participate in the rental process together with the club staff to gain rental experience.<br/><img src='/images/28.png'>
